                Android is one of the major operating systems in the market with billions of user base. To ease users'
                everyday activities there exists many apps in the Google Play store as their primary download resource.
                With the increase in the number of applications available in the play store, there exists some confusion
                among users. Our primary goal of the project is to create visualizations that help the users select
                appropriate apps based on their requirements and also to help manufacturers understand the trends of app
                usage based on factors like app category, reviews, price, ratings, and installs. We made interactive
                visualizations for each of the above elements which can be filtered by the users and have added various
                charts to understand the choice of customers on their selections.

                Google Play store and app store have millions of downloads every day and to help users identify the apps
                they are looking for among the thousands of apps present, we wanted to develop a Power Bi visualization
                that details and presents various options giving the user a chance to filter in the apps as per their
                requirements. Our dataset consists of data in CSV format which includes a CSV file of 9660 unique app
                values with details of the category they belong to, ratings, reviews, size, installs, prizes, and genres
                of the apps. Our dataset consists of about 9.0 MB with various values needed to implement the
                visualizations and has been extracted from <a

                    Our plan was to make easily understandable and effective visualizations. So we initially thought of
                    adding all the visualizations in a singular box format without the need to shift to other pages to
                    have ease of access. Once we were clear on the types of charts to add we thought of adding filters
                    to the side as in the below picture. We then came across a few blockers as we needed additional
                    pages and adding side-by-side filters became a challenge.

                    layout, the heat map is replaced with a tree map, the Bar chart is changed to a vertical bar chart.
                    A World map is also added to display information about the number of applications owned by each

                their impact on the downloads made by users. Interestingly we noticed that the number of updates being
                released does not have any effect on the number of downloads.
                <br>
                <br>
                One possible explanation for this could be, that the users arenâ€™t aware of a new version release or are
                happy with the existing version or that the majority of the updates/version changes being made might not
                be huge changes to demand the installation of an additional download.

                almost similar user ratings, but when it comes to use, the unpaid apps are far more installed when
                compared to the paid ones.

                To answer this question, we can select the paid category in the donut chart, social as a category in the most downloaded app category, and the release time, we choose the time in which the app was released. The average rating appearing on the scorecards can be found to be 4.23.

                From the visualizations created, we are able to conclude the below observations:
                <ol>
                  <li>From the first chart, the Majority of the updates belonged to gaming apps, which made sense as new
                    features would be released as a new version update for this genre.</li>
                  <li>With the release of a new version, the installations vary unevenly, based on the performance of
                    the updates.</li>
                  <li>From the donut chart, we were able to decipher the most paid apps belonged to the family genre,
                    for example, people preferred to buy family games to play together.</li>
                  <li>From the categories bar chart and target audience pie chart we can observe that gaming apps as
                    expected have mostly targeted teenagers and youngsters.</li>
                  <li>For each installation, we were also able to note the total number of installations, user ratings,
                    and app counts with the help of scorecards.</li>

                With the help of the project and course, we were able to understand how to visualize the data
                effectively and make necessary analyses from it. We were able to perform data cleaning and data
                aggregations for visuals while choosing colors and designs that would elevate the insights we wished to
                share, without deviating from the data itself. Additionally, we were able to reduce unnecessary junk
                additions and make concise charts for the visuals.
